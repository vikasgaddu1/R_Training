# Exercise Step 2
# Starting with the vectors, TrtName <- "Trt",  TrtList <- c("A","B","C"),
# SiteName <- "Site", SiteList <- 12:14. Create the following vectors.

# String Operations pt 1 --------------------------------------------------

# Exercise Step 2
# Run the code below to define some variables.
cost = 123.56
retail = 495.25
margin = (retail - cost)
percent_markup = margin / cost

# Use these variables with some additional text, and the functions `str_glue()`
# and the `"{}" `function, to create the following sentence.
# Each pill pack costs 123.56 and is sold for 495.25 resulting in a % markup of 3.00817416639689.
str_glue(
  "Each pill pack costs {cost} and is sold for {retail} resulting in a % markup of {percent_markup}."
)

# String Operations pt 2 --------------------------------------------------

# Exercise Step 3
# Create a variable named sentence which is equal to
# "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.".
sentence <- 
"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

# Exercise Step 4
# find beginning and ending position of the string "lazy"
lazy <- str_locate(sentence, "lazy")

# Exercise Step 5
# Switch the words fox around with dog.
new_sentence <- str_replace(sentence, "dog", "fox") %>%
  str_replace("fox", "dog")
new_sentence

# Exercise Step 6
# Remove the word lazy from the sentence in the previous step. Make sure there
# is only one space between every word.
new_sentence <-
  new_sentence %>%
  str_remove("lazy") %>%
  str_squish()

# Subsets and Formats -----------------------------------------------------

# Exercise Step 2
# We created a string earlier that said that  the pill pack costs, it's price and the
# resulting markup. However, it wasn't very pretty. Use the new functions,
# dollar() and percent(), to make it look like.
# Each pill pack costs $123.56 and is sold for $495.25 resulting in a % markup of 300.8%
# Use the functions str_glue(), dollar(), and percent().
context <- str_glue(
  "Each pill pack costs {dollar(cost, accuracy = .01)} and is sold for {dollar(cost, accuracy = .01)} resulting in a % markup of {percent(percent_markup, accuracy = .1)}."
)
