# Excercise Step 5.b
# Scatterplot of PULSE by ARM

# Excercise Step 5.C
# Scatterplot of PULSE by BMI colored by ARM

# Excercise Step 6
# Look in the vignette for ggplot2 and find two other shapes that are
# interesting. Redo two of the three plots above with those shapes. Use the
# name for one shape and the number for the other.

# shape = 8

# Create a scatterplot of PULSE by BMI. Set the shape according to the SITEID. We have 8 Site ID's (we are missing Site #5). What did ggplot2 warn us about with regard to using shapes and what was its behavior? Looking at the plot, do you agree?

# Excercise Step 8
# Create a scatterplot of PULSE by BMI. Define the shape with ARM. What warning does ggplot2 give about using shapes? Why does it give this warning? What aesthetics could you use to overcome this problem? Why do they work where shape did not? Which one do you think works better?

# Vertical stacked bar chart showing counts of ARM by SEX

# Excercise Step 5.d

# Histogram of PULSE stacking by SEX using 10 bins.

# Excercise Step 5.g
# Density plot of PULSE with each SITEID having its own line type.
