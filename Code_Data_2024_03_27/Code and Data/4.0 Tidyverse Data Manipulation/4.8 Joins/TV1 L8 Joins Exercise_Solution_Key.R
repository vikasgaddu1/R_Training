# Exercise Step 3
# Run the following code to define demographic data for three different studies.
# Note the differences in the data structures.
demo_a <- tribble(
  ~study, ~inv, ~patient, ~sex
  ,"StudyA", 2000, 1, "M"
)

demo_b <- tribble(
  ~study, ~inv, ~patient, ~sex
  ,"StudyB", 2000, 1, "F"
)

demo_c <- tribble(
  ~study, ~inv, ~patient, ~sex
  ,"StudyC", 2000, 1, 2
)

# Exercise Step 4
# Combine the rows for `demo_a` and `demo_b`. Any problems?
bind_rows(demo_a, demo_b)

# Exercise Step 5
# Now combine the rows for all three data frames. Does that work?
bind_rows(demo_a, demo_b, demo_c)

# Exercise Step 6
# Write code that would allow you to combine the rows for all three data frames.
# Can you do it in one piped statement?
demo <-
  demo_c %>%
  mutate(sex = ifelse(sex == 1, "M", "F")) %>%

# Tidyverse Joins ---------------------------------------------------------

# Exercise Step 3
# Run the following code to define a `demo` and `otherdata` data set.
# Notice the variable `other` exists in both the `demo` and `otherdata` data set.
# Examine the resulting data after the join in the console.

  ,2, "B", "Normal"
  ,2, "1", "Normal"
  ,1, "1", "Abnormal"
  ,2, "S", "Abnormal"
) %>% 
  print()

# Exercise Step 4
# Join these two data sets by patient. What are your conclusions about
# “many to many” joins? i.e. Repeats of by values in more than one
# data set during a join.
inner_join(demo, otherdata, join_by(patient), relationship = "many-to-many")

  ,1, "1", "Abnormal"

  ,2, "B", "Normal"
  ,2, "1", "Normal"

# Exercise Step 6
# Join these two data sets by patient. Examine the resulting data after
# the join in the console. How does R handle the same "non-by" variable existing
# in both data sets during a join?
inner_join(demo, otherdata, by = "patient")


# Exercise Step 8
# Using the read_sas() function from the haven package, read in the following

#    STUDYID, SITEID, SUBJID, ARM, SEX, RACE, AGE).
